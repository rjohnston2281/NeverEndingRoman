/*
 * Roman Empire Manifest
 *
 * This manifest tells Legacy's mod loader which data files make up the mod. When you
 * include a mod in the main menu mod list, the game reads the manifest and pulls
 * in each dataset. The key on the left of the updates object is the humanâ€‘readable
 * name that will show up in the mod list, suffixed by a '^' to indicate it's
 * a user mod (the default dataset uses '*'). The value on the right is the
 * filename of the JavaScript file that defines that dataset.
